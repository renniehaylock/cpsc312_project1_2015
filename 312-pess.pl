% This file is broken into sections using banners like the
% "Introduction" banner that begins this section. The key sections are: 
% - Interpreter loop: defines the entry point main/0 that gives a
%   command prompt from which users can easily load files and solve
%   problems.  This is left for you to write!
% - Solving, asking, and proving: defines solve/0, which starts
%   the expert system solving whatever the current top goal is.
%   "ask" and "prove" are used to ask the user about the truth
%   of goals or reason about them, respectively. 
% - Flattening attributes: Mostly a helper section for the "prove"
%   predicate.  This defines flatten_attr/2, which takes a goal
%   (attribute) and turns it into a large (ideally exhaustive) set 
%   of implied goals.
% - Rule loading: load_rules/1 loads natural language rules from a 
%   knowledge base (file)


% Here are some helpful pieces of general code:

% This section includes the solve, ask, and prove predicates which 
% together form the heart of the expert system shell.  solve initiates 
% an interaction with the shell (in which it tries to solve the user's 
% top goal), 'ask' asks the user whether a given assertion is true or
% false, and 'prove' recursively proves assertions (essentially using
% Prolog's own depth-first, backtracking search solution scheme).

% Although this section does NOT reason about natural language
% representations of rules, the ask predicate does use plain_gloss/2 to
% transform internal rule/goal representations into human-readable
% representations for printing.

% Rules and goals take the following form:
% - a rule is an instance of the rule/2 functor; its first argument is
%   the rule's head (a single instance of attr/3) while its second
%   argument is the rule's body (a list of instances of attr/3). Rules
%   "mean" the same thing that they do in normal Prolog statements,
%   e.g., a rule with a head meaning "it is sunny" and a body meaning
%   "the sky is cloudless and it is daytime" means "if the sky is
%   cloudless and it is daytime, then it is sunny". Similarly, rules
%   with empty bodies are facts.
% - a goal (including the body elements and head of rules) is an
%   instance of the attr/3 predicate. The first argument of attr is a
%   type, which must be an atom (and, for now, is one of is_a, has_a,
%   is_like, and is_how); the second argument of attr is the
%   attribute's value and may be any atom; and the third argument of
%   attr is a list of attached attributes, each of which is itself an
%   instance of attr/3.

% At a basic level, solving a goal (attr/3 instance) means finding rules
% that connect that goal to other goals until the goals bottom out
% (i.e., there is no rule whose head matches a goal). At this point,
% PESS's algorithm differs from Prolog's in that it asks the user
% whether the goal is true or false rather than concluding (by the
% closed world assumption) that the goal is definitely false.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% solve %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Solve clears out working memory (the known/1 predicate) and then
% attempts to prove a canonical "top goal".
% Currently, the top goal is set by hand at the same time the database is
% emptied (in clear_db).
% Answers are also of a fairly simple form and could be more complex,
% reflecting the structure of the knowledge base.

%% Compound attribute flattening.                      %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Attribute structures (as described above) can be quite complex.
% Furthermore, certain attributes imply other attributes. For example,
% if it has long, sharp claws, then it surely has long claws, and has
% sharp claws, and has claws.

% flatten_attr calculates the list of smaller attributes 
% corresponding to one larger attribute (all those attributes
% that are NOT conjunctive that are implied by the original
% attribute; that is, for each attr(Type, Value, SubAttributes) 
% in the flattened attribute list, SubAttributes is either empty or
% has one element.)
% This is useful for a few reasons:
% - each of these "flattened" attributes is implied by the original
% - conversely, if any of these flattened attributes is false, the
%   original is also false
% - finally, if all of these flattened attributes can be proven, 
%   so too can the original.
% In fact, that last requirement is too strong in a sense. Only the
% "deepest" attributes need to be proven; the shallower ones are implied
% as they are flattened versions of the deeper ones. On the other hand,
% the last requirement is also too weak. The following example
% illustrates..
%
% For example, it slowly eats small insects and worms.
% The flattened version includes:
% - it eats
% - it slowly eats
% - it eats insects
% - it eats small insects
% - it eats worms
% Each of these is clearly implied by the overall statement.
% Furthermore, if any of them are false, the overall statement is false.
% However, as long as we have "it eats small insects", we clearly don't
% need "it eats insects" to prove the overall statement.  Unfortunately,
% the handling of adverbs is not quite right.  "it slowly eats" and
% "it eats insects" does NOT imply that "it slowly eats insects".
%
% Some notes about fixing the flattened true -> original true assertion:
% - There's really no need to fix the fact that the statement is too 
%   strong.  As long as the flattened attributes are proven IN REVERSE
%   ORDER, each implied attribute will already have been proven (and
%   so be in the knowledge base) by the time the proof process reaches
%   it.
% - To fix the fact that the statement is too weak, I would NOT change
%   flatten_attr.  Instead, I would change the way the parser represents
%   rules and goals.  For example, "it slowly eats insects" might become
%   something like:
%     attr(does, eats, [attr(is_how, slowly, [attr(is_a, insects, [])])]) 
%   rather than:
%     attr(does, eats, [attr(is_how, slowly,  []),
%                       attr(is_a,   insects, []) ])
%   so that it's clearly that "insects" is dependent on "slowly eats",
%   not just on "eats".  That would require changes both to the parser
%   and to the glosser.
