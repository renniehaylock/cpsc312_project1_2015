README FOR QUESTION 1

My domain is about vehicles and there is one funny one in there about food, but the main subject are vehicles.

The first rule describes a race car, only if it had thick and wide tires and ran on the track with low ride height.

The second describes a bicycle, only if it has thin wheels and sits one person and has a tublar frame.

The third one describes a boat, only if it has external motors and floats on water and has sails.

The fourth and amusing one is a pizza, only if its shape is round and it feeds five people and smells awesome and has cheese toppings.

It was difficult and frustrating to write rules when you aren't sure about the facts of the domain yourself. You would rarely metally ask yourself what makes this this, so that can be troublesome, however what was simple was understanding the syntax of the rules because there was a file for reference.
